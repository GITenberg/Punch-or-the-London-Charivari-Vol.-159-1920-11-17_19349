<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>
It is rumoured that a gentleman who
purchased a miniature two-seater car at
the Motor Show last week arrived home
one night to find the cat playing with
it on the mat.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
It appears that nothing definite has
yet been decided as to whether <i>The
Daily Mail</i> will publish a Continental
edition of the Sandringham Hat.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
The matter having passed out of the
hands of D.O.R.A., the Westminster
City Council recommend the abolition
of the practice of whistling for cabs at
night. Nothing is said about the custom
of making a noise like a five-shilling
tip.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
We shall not be surprised
if Mr. <span class="sc">Austen
Chamberlain</span> becomes
the Viceroy of India,
says a gossip-writer.
We warn our contemporary
against being
elated, for it is almost
certain that another
Chancellor of the Exchequer
would be appointed
in his place.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
During the Lord
Mayor's Show last week
we understand that the
<span class="sc">Lord Mayor's</span> coachman
was accompanied
by the <span class="sc">Lord Mayor</span>.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
The licensee of a West
Ham public-house has
just purchased a parrot
which is trained to imitate
the bagpipes. The bird's life will
of course be insured.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
Ireland will have to be careful or
she will be made safe for democracy,
like the other countries.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
Upon hearing that Mr. <span class="sc">William
Brace</span> had accepted a Government
appointment several members of the
Labour Party said that this only confirmed
their contention that his moustache
would get him into trouble
one day.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
Mrs. <span class="sc">Stackpool O'Dell</span> warns girls
against marrying a man whose head is
flat at the back. The best course is
to get one with a round head; after
marriage it can be flattened to taste.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
A man who persistently refused to
give any information about himself was
remanded at the Guildhall last week.
He is thought to be a British taxpayer
going about <i>incognito</i>.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
The cackle of a hen when she lays an
egg, says a scientist, is akin to laughter.
And with some of the eggs we have
met we can easily guess what the hen
was laughing at.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
The National Collection of Microbes
at the Lister Institute now contains
eight hundred different specimens. Visitors
are requested not to tease the
germs or go too near their cages.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
A large spot on the sun has been seen
by the meteorological experts at Greenwich
Observatory. We understand that
it will be allowed to remain.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Raymond Forsdik</span>, of Chicago,
states that twelve times more murders
are committed in Chicago than in
London. But, under Prohibition, Satan
is bound to find mischief for idle
hands.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
Canon F. J. Meyrick, of Norwich, is
reported to have caught a pike weighing
twenty-five pounds. In view of
the angler's profession we suppose we
must believe this one.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
A curate of Bedford Park has had
his bicycle stolen from the church, and
as there were a number of people in
the congregation it is difficult to know
whom to blame.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
"Shall Onkie Live?" asks a <i>Daily
Mail</i> headline. We don't know who
he is, but he certainly has our permission.
We cannot, however, answer for
Mr. <span class="sc">Bob Williams</span>.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
With reference to the complaint that
a City man made about his telephone,
we are pleased to say that a great improvement
is reported. The instrument
was taken away the other day.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
Discussing the remuneration of Cabinet
Ministers a contemporary doubts
whether they get what they deserve.
This only goes to prove that we are a
humane race.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
Hatters say that the price of rabbit
skins is likely to ruin the trade. Meanwhile
the mere act of getting the skins
is apt to ruin the rabbit.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
"Mine," says General <span class="sc">Townshend</span>,
"was a mission which <span class="sc">Napoleon</span> would
have refused." We
doubt, however, if Lord
<span class="sc">Northcliffe</span> is to be
drawn like that.</p>

        <hr class="short" />
<p>
Dr. <span class="sc">E. Halford Ross</span>,
of Piccadilly, is of the
opinion that coal contains
remarkable healing
powers. Quite a
number of people contemplate
buying some
of the stuff.</p>

        <hr class="short" />

"What does milk usually
contain?" asks a
weekly paper. We can
only say it wouldn't be
fair for us to reply, as
we know the answer.</p>

<h3>UNAUTHENTIC IMPRESSIONS.</h3>

<h4>II.&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr. Winston Churchill</span>.</h4>
<p>
If it be urged that a few trifling inaccuracies
have crept into the sketch
which is here given of a great statesman's
personality I can only say,
"<i>Humanum est errare</i>," and "<i>Homo
sum: humani nihil alienum a me puto</i>."
These two Latin sentences, I find, invariably
soothe all angry passions; you
have only to try their effect the next
time you stamp on the foot of a stout
man when alighting from an Underground
train.</p>
<p>
Of all the present-day politicians, and
indeed there are not a few, upon whose
mantelpieces the bust of <span class="sc">Napoleon
Bonaparte</span> is displayed, Mr. <span class="sc">Winston
Churchill</span> is probably the most assiduous
worshipper at the great Corsican's
shrine. How often has he not entered
his sanctum at the War Office, peering
forward with that purposeful dominating
look on his face, and discovered a
few specks of dust upon his favourite
effigy. With a quick characteristic
motion of the thumb resembling a stab
he rings the bell. A flunkey instantly
appears. "Bust that dust," says the
<span class="sc">War Minister</span>. And then, correcting
himself instantly, with a genial smile,
"I should say, Dust that bust."</p>
<p>
But <span class="sc">Napoleon's</span> is not the only head
that adorns Mr. <span class="sc">Winston Churchill's</span>
room. On a bookshelf opposite is a
model of his own head, such as one
may sometimes see in the shop windows
of hatters, and close beside is a small
private hat-making plant, together with
an adequate supply of the hair of the
rabbit, the beaver, the vicuna and similar
rodents, and a quantity of shellac. Few
days pass in which the <span class="sc">War Minister</span>
does not spend an hour or two at his
charming hobby, for, contrary to the
general opinion, he is far from satisfied
with the headgear by which he is so
well known, or even with the Sandringham
hat of <i>The Daily Mail</i>, and lives
always in hopes of modelling the ideal
hat which is destined to immortalise
him and be worn by others for centuries
to come. The work of a great statesman
lives frequently in the mindful brain
of posterity, less frequently upon it.</p>
<p>
Other mementos which adorn this
remarkable room at the War Office are
a porcelain pot containing a preserve
of Blenheim oranges, a framed photograph
of the Free Trade Hall at Manchester,
a map of Mesopotamia with
the outpost lines and sentry groups of
the original Garden of Eden, marked by
paper flags, and a number of lion-skin
rugs of which the original occupants
were stalked and killed by their owner
on his famous African tour. In his
more playful moments the <span class="sc">War Minister</span>
has been known to clothe himself
completely in one of these skins
and growl ferociously from behind a
palm at an unwelcome intruder.</p>
<p>
Of the man himself perhaps the most
distinguishing characteristic is dynamic
energy. Whether other people's energy
is ever dynamic I do not know, but
undoubtedly Mr. <span class="sc">Winston Churchill's</span>
is; he dominates, he quells. He is like
one of those people in the papers with
zig-zags sticking out all over them
because they have been careful to wear
an electric belt. He exudes force. Sometimes
one can almost hear him crackle.</p>
<p>
As a politician it is true he has not
yet tried every office; he has not, for
instance, been Chancellor of the Exchequer,
though his unbounded success
in the Duchy of Lancaster amply shows
what his capabilities as a Chancellor
are. But as a soldier, a pig-sticker and
a polo-player he is rapidly gaining pre-eminence,
and as an author and journalist
his voice is already like a swan's
amongst screech-owls. (I admit that
that last bit ought to have been in Latin,
but I cannot remember what the Latin
for a screech-owl is. I have an idea that
it increases in the genitive, but quite
possibly I may be thinking of dormice.)</p>
<p>
Anyhow, to return to Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill's</span>
room: whilst the floor is littered with
volumes that have been sent to him for
review, his desk is equally littered with
proofs of essays, sermons, leaders and
leaderettes for the secular and Sunday
Press. As a novelist he has scarcely
fulfilled his early promise, but it is on
record that he was once introduced to
a stranger from the backwoods, who
asked ignorantly, "Am I speaking to
the statesman or the author?"</p>
<p>
"Not <i>or</i>, but <i>and</i>," replied the <span class="sc">Secretary
of State for War</span>, with a simple
dignity like that of <span class="sc">St. Augustine</span>.</p>
<p>
To poetry he is not greatly attached,
preferring to leave this field of letters
to his staff. When asked for his
favourite passage of English verse he
has indeed been known to cite a single
line from Mr. <span class="sc">Hilaire Belloc's</span> <i>Modern
Traveller</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"That marsh, that admirable marsh!"</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
which is far from being Mr. <span class="sc">Belloc's</span>
most mellifluous effort.</p>
<p>
We feel bound to ask what is most
likely to be the next outlet for Mr.
<span class="sc">Churchill's</span> ebullient activity. Remembering
that bust upon his mantelpiece
it is hard to say. There are some
who consider that, prevented by the
sluggishness of our times from the

<h3>SOURCES OF LAUGHTER.</h3>
<p>
"It will have to be a great deal
funnier than that before it's funny,"
said George.</p>
<p>
This represented the general opinion,
though Edna, who has a good heart,
professed to find it diverting already.
Unfortunately she has no sense of
humour.</p>
<p>
Jerry, the writer, claimed exemption
on the ground of being the writer,
though he did not see why his article
should not remove gravity (as they say
in <i>The Wallet of Kai Lung</i>) from other
people quite as effectually as the silly
tosh of A. and B. and C., naming some
brilliant and successful humorists.</p>
<p>
The company then resolved itself into
a Voluntary Aid Detachment.</p>
<p>
When they met again at tea Edna
made the suggestion of a sprinkling of
puns.</p>
<p>
"We've got rather beyond that, I
think," said the victim with dignity.</p>
<p>
"I'm not so sure," said George
cruelly, "that you can afford to neglect
any means. Some people laugh at them
even now, in this twentieth century,
in this beautiful England of ours."</p>
<p>
"And I can tell you why," broke in
Raymond eagerly. He took from his
pocket a well-known Manual of Psychology
and whirled over the pages.</p>
<p>
"Meanwhile," said George learnedly,
"<span class="sc">Bergson</span> may be of some assistance
to you. He knows all about laughter.
He analysed it."</p>
<p>
"Why couldn't he leave it alone?"
said Allegra uneasily.</p>
<p>
"He defines laughter," said George,
"as 'a kind of social gesture.'"</p>
<p>
"It isn't," said Allegra rashly. "At
least," she added, "that sort of thing
isn't going to help Jerry. Do give it
up."</p>
<p>
"Well, then, here's something more
practical," said George. "Listen. 'A
situation is always comical when it
belongs at one and the same time to
two series of absolutely independent
events, and can at the same time be
interpreted in two different ways.'"</p>
<p>
"I should think," said Edna brightly,
"that might be very amusing."</p>
<p>
She remarked later that it made it
all seem very clear, but even she showed
signs of relief when Raymond interrupted,
having found his place.</p>
<p>
"Here we are!" he exclaimed. "The
book says that the reason a pun
amuses you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>
"It doesn't amuse me," said most of
the company.</p>
<p>
"But it does&mdash;it must amuse you.
It's all down here in black and white.
Listen. The reason a pun amuses you
is as follows: 'It impels the mind
to identify objects quite disconnected.
This obstructs the flow of thought;
but this is too transient to give rise to
pain, and the relief which comes with
insight into the true state of the case
may be a source of keen pleasure.
Mental activity suddenly obstructed
and so heightened is at once set free,
and is so much greater than the occasion
demands that&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>
<p>
"And is that why we laugh at
things?" said Allegra sadly.</p>
<p>
The heavy silence which followed
was broken by the voice of Mrs. Purkis,
the charlady, who "comes in to oblige,"
and was now taking a short cut to the
front gate, under Cook's escort, by way
of the parsley bed. This brought her
within earshot of the party, who were
taking tea on the lawn.</p>
<p>
When Mrs. Purkis could contain her
mirth so as to make herself understood,
her words were these: "I dunno why,
but when I see 'im stand like that,
staring like a stuck pig, I thought I'd
died a-larf'n. I dunno why, but it
made me <i>larf</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>
She passed, like <i>Pippa</i>.</p>
<p>
"Listen to her," said Allegra in bitter
envy. "<i>She doesn't know why.</i>"</p>
<p>
And Allegra burst into tears.</p>

<h3>AT THE BLOATER SHOW.</h3>
<p>
The last time I was at Olympia&mdash;as
everybody says at the door&mdash;it was
a Horse Show. But this time it is much
the same. There they stand in their
stalls, the dear, magnificent, patient
creatures, with their glossy coats and
their beautiful curves, their sensitive
radiators sniffing for something over
the velvet ropes. Panting, I know they
are, to be out in the open again; and
yet I fancy they enjoy it all in a way.
It would be ungrateful if they did not;
for, after all, the whole thing has been
arranged for them. The whole idea of
the Show is to let the motors inspect the
bloaters&mdash;and not what you think. (You
don't know what bloaters are? Well,
I can't explain without being rude.)</p>
<p>
All the year round they can study <i>ad
nauseam</i> their own individual bloaters;
but this is the only occasion on which
they have the whole world of bloaters
paraded in front of them for inspection.
Now only can they compare notes and
exchange grievances.</p>
<p>
And how closely they study the
parade! Here is a pretty limousine, a
blonde; see how she watches the two
huge exhibits in front of her. They
are very new bloaters, and one of them&mdash;oh,
horror!&mdash;one of them is going to
buy. He has never bought before; she
knows his sort. He will drive her to
death; he may even drive her himself;
he will stroke her lovely coat in a familiar,
proprietary fashion; he will show
her off unceasingly to other bloaters till
she is hot all over and the water boils in
her radiator. He will hold forth with
a horrible intimacy and a yet more
horrible ignorance on the most private
secrets of her inner life. Not one
throb of her young cylinders will be
sacred, yet never will he understand
her as she would like to be understood.
He will mess her with his muddy boots;
he will scratch her paint; he will drop
tobacco-ash all over her cushions&mdash;not
from pipes; cigars only....</p>
<p>
There&mdash;he has bought her. It is a
tragedy. Let us move on.</p>
<p>
Here is a little <i>coupé</i>&mdash;a smart young
creature with a nice blue coat, fond of
town, I should say, but quite at home
in the country. She also is inspecting
two bloaters. But these two are very
shy. In fact they are not really bloaters
at all; they are rather a pair of nice-mannered
fresh herrings, not long mated.
The male had something to do with that
war, I should think; the <i>coupé</i> would
help him a good deal. The lady likes
her because she is dark-blue. The other
one likes her because of something to
do with her works; but he is very
reverent and tactful about it. He seems
to know that he is being scrutinised,
for he is nervous, and scarcely dares to
speak about her to the groom in the
top-hat. He will drive her himself; he
will look after her himself; he will
know all about her, all about her moods
and fancies and secret failings; he will
humour and coax her, and she will
serve him very nobly.</p>
<p>
Already, you see, they have given her
a name&mdash;"Jane," I think they said;
they will creep off into the country
with her when the summer comes, all
by themselves; they will plunge into
the middle of thick forests and sit down
happily in the shade at midday and
look at her; and she will love them.</p>
<p>
But the question is&mdash;&mdash;Ah, they
are shaking their heads; they are edging
away. She is too much. They look back
sadly as they go. Another tragedy....</p>
<p>
Now I am going to be a bloater myself.
Here is a jolly one, though her
stable-name is much too long. She is
a Saloon-de-Luxe, and she only costs
£2,125 (why 5, I wonder&mdash;why not
6?) I can run to that, <i>surely</i>. At
any rate I can climb up and sit down
on her cushions; none of the grooms is
looking. Dark-blue, I see, like Jane.
That is the sort of car I love. I am
like the lady herring; I don't approve
of all this talk about the <i>insides</i> of
things; it seems to me to be rather
indecent&mdash;unless, of course, you do it
very nicely, like that young herring.
When you go and look at a horse you
don't ask how its sweetbread is arranged,
or what is the principle of its liver.
Then why should you...?</p>
<p>
Well, here we are, and very comfortable
too. But why does none of these
cars have any means of communication
between the owner and the man next to
the chauffeur? There is always a telephone
to the chauffeur, but none to
the overflow guest on the box. So that
when the host sees an old manor-house
which he thinks the guest hasn't noticed
he has to hammer on the glass
and do semaphore; and the guest thinks
he is being asked if he is warm enough.</p>
<p>
Otherwise, though, this is a nice car.
It is very cosy in here. Dark and quiet
and warm. I could go to sleep in here.</p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>
What? What's that? No, I don't
really want to buy it, thank you. I
just wanted to see if it was a good
sleeping-car. As a matter of fact I
think it is. But I don't like the colour.
And what I really want is a <i>cabriolet</i>.
Good afternoon. Thank you....</p>
<p>
A pleasant gentleman, that. I wish
I could have bought the Saloon. She
would have liked me. So would he, I
expect.</p>
<p>
Well, we had better go home. I
shan't buy any more cars to-day. And
we won't go up to the gallery; there is
nothing but oleo-plugs and graphite-grease
up there. That sort of thing
spoils the romance.</p>
<p>
Ah, here is dear Jane again!    What
a pity it was&mdash;&mdash; Hallo, they have
come back&mdash;the two nice herrings.
They are bargaining&mdash;they are beating
him down. No, he is beating them up.
Go on&mdash;go on. Yes, you can run to
that&mdash;<i>of course</i> you can. Sell those oil
shares. Look at her&mdash;<i>look</i> at her! You
can't leave her here for one of the
bloaters. He wavers; he consults.
"Such a lovely colour." Ah, that's
done it! He has decided. He has
bought. She has bought. They have
bought. Hurrah!</p>

<h4>THE PREMIER'S METAPHORS.</h4>
<p>
Some time ago the <span class="sc">Premier</span> beheld
the sunrise upon the mountains, and
now he has plunged his thermometer
into the lava to discover that the stream
is cooling&mdash;indicating comfort, let us
hope, to any who may be buried beneath
it. Only by an oversight, we understand,
did he omit to mention in his
speech at the Guildhall that the chamois
is once more browsing happily among
the blooming edelweiss.</p>
<p>
But in continuing his lofty metaphors
Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> will find himself
confronted by no small difficulty when
dealing with the glacier. What can he
say that the glacier is doing? It must
do something. A glacier is of no rhetorical
value if it merely stays where it
is. One may take in hand the ice-axe
of resolution and the alpenstock of enterprise
and pull over one's boots the
socks of Coalition, but the glacier remains
practically unchanged by these
preparations. It would be of little use
to declare that its uneven surface is
being levelled by the steam-roller of
progress and its crevasses filled in by
the cement of human kindness, because
the Opposition Press would soon get
scientists, engineers and statisticians to
establish the absurdity of such a claim.
And to announce that the glacier is
getting warmer would create no end of
a panic among the homesteads in the
valley. Unless he is very, very careful
Mr. <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> may make a grave
slip in negotiating the glacier.</p>
<p>
Then the "awful avalanche" has not
yet been dealt with. A few helpful
words on the direction this is likely to
take and the safest rock to make for
when it begins to move might be welcomed
by the <span class="sc">Premier's</span> followers. He
may argue that it is folly to meet trouble
half-way, but on the other hand, if
he does not speak on this subject soon,
the opportunity may disappear. Let
him avoid the glacier if he chooses; he
cannot (so we are informed) escape the
avalanche.</p>

<h3>THE  SAYINGS   OF   BARBARA.</h3>
<p>
The man who sets out to expose
popular fallacies or to confound time-honoured
legends is bound to make
enemies.</p>
<p>
The latest legend I have been privileged
to explore is not the product
of superstition and slow time, but a
deliberately manufactured growth of
comparatively recent origin. It is concerned
with Barbara, not the impersonal
lady who figures in the old logic-book
doggerel, but an extremely live and
highly illogical person to whom for
half a decade I have had the honour to
be father. It is also concerned with
Barbara's Aunt Julia and, in a lesser
degree, with Barbara's mother.</p>
<p>
From the time (just
over three years ago)
when Barbara first attempted
articulate
speech I have been
bombarded with reports
of the wonderful things
my daughter has said.
In the earlier years
these diverting stories,
for which Julia was
nearly always cited as
authority, reached me
through the medium of
the Field Post-Office,
and, being still fairly
new to fatherhood, I
used proudly to retail
them in Mess, until an
addition was made to
the rule relating to offences
punishable by a
round of drinks.</p>
<p>
On my brief visits
home I would wait expectantly
for the brilliant
flashes of humour or of uncanny
intelligence to issue from Barbara's lips,
and her failure during these periods to
sustain her reputation I was content to
explain on the assumption that I came
within the category of casual visitors.
But I have now lived in my own home
for over a year, and Barbara and I have
become very well acquainted. She talks
to me without restraint, and at times
most engagingly, but seldom, if ever,
does she give utterance in my hearing to
a <i>jeu d'esprit</i> that I feel called upon to
repeat to others. Nevertheless until a
few days ago I was still constantly being
informed&mdash;chiefly by Barbara's aunt
and less frequently by her mother&mdash;of
the "killing" things that child had been
saying. I grew privately sceptical, but
had no proof, and it was only by accident
that I was at last enabled to prick
the bubble.</p>
<p>
Julia (who besides being Barbara's
aunt is Suzanne's sister) had come to
tea and was chatting in the drawing-room
with Suzanne (who besides being
Julia's sister is Barbara's mother and
my wife) and Barbara (whose relationship
all round has been sufficiently
indicated). The drawing-room door was
open, and so was that of my study on
the opposite side of the passage, where
I was coquetting with a trifle of work.
The conversation, which I could not
help overhearing, was confined for the
most part to Julia and Barbara, and ran
more or less on the following lines:&mdash;</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> Where's Father, Babs?</p>
<p>
<i>Barbara.</i> In the libery.</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> Working hard, I suppose?</p>
<p>
<i>Barbara.</i> Yes.</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> Or do you think he's sleeping?
(<i>No answer.</i>) Don't you think
father's probably asleep half the time
he's supposed to be working?</p>
<p>
<i>Barbara.</i> Probly. What you got in
that bag?</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> I expect that big armchair he
sits in is just a weeny bit too comfy for
real work.</p>
<p>
<i>Barbara.</i> I've eated up all those
choc'lates you did bring me.</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> Perhaps we'll find some more
presently. Do you think Father writes
in his sleep?</p>
<p>
<i>Barbara.</i> Yes, I fink he does.</p>
<p>
<i>Julia.</i> Listen to her, Suzie. I expect
really he only dreams he's working.
Don't you, Babs?</p>
<p>
At this point I thought it advisable,
for the sake of preserving the remnants
of my parental authority, to come in to
tea. Julia was handing Barbara a
packet of chocolate, and greeted me
with an arch inquiry as to whether I
had been busy writing. I replied with
a hearty affirmative.</p>
<p>
"You ought to hear what your
daughter has been saying about you,"
said Julia.</p>
<p>
"Oh, and what does Barbara say?"
I asked.</p>
<p>
"She says that when Father sits in
that stuffy little room of his he usually
writes in his sleep. She really does
take the most amazing notice of things,
and the way she expresses herself is
quite weird."</p>
<p>
"So Barbara says I write in my
sleep?"</p>
<p>
"Yes, you heard her, didn't you,
Suzie? Oh, and did I tell you that the
other day, during that heavy thunderstorm,
she said that the angels and the
devils must be having a big battle and
that she supposed the angels would
soon be going over the
top?"</p>
<p>
"Come here, Barbara,"
I said.</p>
<p>
Barbara, who at her
too fond aunt's request
had been granted the
privilege of taking tea
in the drawing-room,
stuffed the better half of
a jam sandwich into her
mouth and came.</p>
<p>
"Do you see those
rich-looking pink
cakes?" I asked her.
"You shall have one as
soon as we've had a
little talk."</p>
<p>
"The biggest and
pinkiest one?" demanded
Barbara.</p>
<p>
"Yes. Now tell me&mdash;don't
you think that
people ought always to
speak the truth, and to
be especially careful not
to distort the remarks of others?"</p>
<p>
"Yes. Can I have the one with the
greeny thing on it?"</p>
<p>
"Certainly, in a minute. And don't
you think that women are much more
careless of the truth than men?"</p>
<p>
"Yes. Can I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>
"Do you love your Aunt Julia?"</p>
<p>
"Yes."</p>
<p>
"Why?"</p>
<p>
"Cos she always has got choc'lates
in her bag."</p>
<p>
"But don't you think it's much
more important to have the truth in
your heart than chocolates in your
bag?"</p>
<p>
"Yes. Now can I have my pink
cake?"</p>
<p>
I released and rewarded her, and
Julia prepared to speak her mind.
Fortunately, however, just at that
moment my brother Tom, who is
Barbara's godfather, came in.</p>
<p>
"Why, what a big girl we're getting!" <span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>[pg 389]</span>
he observed to Barbara in his
best godfatherly manner. "I suppose
we shall soon be going to school?"</p>
<p>
"Oh, no, not yet awhile," I interposed.
"The fact is she's already far
too forward, and we think it a good
thing to keep her back a bit. You'd
never believe the amazing remarks she
makes. Just now, for instance, we
happened to be discussing the comparative
love of truth inherent in men
and women, and Barbara chipped in
and told me she thought women were
far more careless of the truth than
men."</p>
<p>
"Good heavens!" said Tom, who is
a bachelor by conviction. "She certainly
hit the nail on the head there."</p>
<p>
"Yes, and she added that she herself
prized truth above chocolates."</p>
<p>
"It sounds almost incredible," gasped
Tom.</p>
<p>
"Doesn't it? But ask Julia; she
heard it all. And Julia will also tell
you what Barbara remarked about my
work."</p>
<p>
But Julia, who was already gathering
her furs about her, followed up an
unusual silence by a sudden departure.</p>
<p>
From what Suzanne has since refrained
from saying I am confident that
I've broken the back of one more
legend, and saved Barbara from the
fate of having to pass the rest of her
childhood living up (or down) to a
spurious halo of precocity.</p>

<h3>YARNS.</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>When the docks are all deserted and the derricks all are still,</p>
<p>And the wind across the anchorage comes singing sad and shrill,</p>
<p>And the lighted lanthorns gleaming where the ships at anchor ride</p>
<p>Cast their quivering long reflections down the ripple of the tide,</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then the ships they start a-yarning, just the same as sailors do</p>
<p>In a hundred docks and harbours from Port Talbot to Chefoo,</p>
<p>Just the same as deep-sea sailormen a-meeting up and down</p>
<p>In the bars and boarding-houses and the streets of Sailor-town.</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Just the same old sort of ship-talk sailors always like to hear&mdash;</p>
<p>Just the same old harbour gossip gathered in from far and near,</p>
<p>In the same salt-water lingo sailors use the wide world round,</p>
<p>From the shores of London river to the wharves of Puget Sound,</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>With a gruff and knowing chuckle at a spicy yarn or so,</p>
<p>And a sigh for some old shipmate gone the way that all men go,</p>
<p>And there's little need to wonder at a grumble now and then,</p>
<p>For the ships must have their growl out, just the same as sailormen.</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And they yarn along together just as jolly as you please,</p>
<p>Lordly liner, dingy freighter rusty-red from all the seas,</p>
<p>Of their cargoes and their charters and their harbours East and West,</p>
<p>And the coal-hulk at her moorings, she is yarning with the best,</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Telling all the same tales over many and many a time she's told,</p>
<p>In a voice that's something creaky now because she's got so old,</p>
<p>Like some old broken sailorman when drink has loosed his tongue</p>
<p>And his ancient heart keeps turning to the days when he was young.</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Is it but the chuckling mutter of the tide along the buoys,</p>
<p>But the creak of straining cables, but the night wind's mournful noise,</p>
<p>Sighing with a rising murmur in among the ropes and spars,</p>
<p>Setting every shroud and backstay singing shanties to the stars?</p></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>No, the ships they all are yarning, just the same as sailors do,</p>
<p>Just the same as deep-sea sailors from Port Talbot to Chefoo,</p>
<p>Yarning through the hours of darkness till the daylight comes again,</p>
<p>But oh! the things they speak of no one knows but sailormen.</p></div>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>
<p>
<i>Monday, November 8th.</i>&mdash;To allay
the apprehensions of Sir <span class="sc">John Rees</span>
the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> informed him that
the League of Nations can do nothing
except by a unanimous decision
of the Council. As the
League already includes thirty-seven
nations, it is not expected
that its decisions will
be hastily reached. Now, perhaps,
the United States may
think better of its refusal to
join a body which has secured
the allegiance of Liberia and of
all the American Republics
save Mexico.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 220px;">
<a href="images/393-1.png"><img src="images/393-1-200.png" width="200" height="280" alt="OBERLEUTNANT KENNWÜRDIG INSPECTS THE REICHSTAG" /></a>
<h5>OBERLEUTNANT KENNWÜRDIG INSPECTS THE REICHSTAG</h5>
<p class="left">(<span class="sc">in the imagination of General Croft</span>).</p>
</div>

<p>
The daily demand for an
impartial inquiry into Irish
"reprisals" met with its daily
refusal. The <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>
referred to "unfortunate incidents
that always happen in
war"&mdash;the first time that he
has used this word to describe
the situation in Ireland&mdash;and
was confident that the sufferers
were, with few exceptions (Mr.
<span class="sc">Devlin</span>, who complained that
his office had been raided, being
one of them), "men engaged in a murderous
conspiracy." He declined to hamper
the authorities who were putting
it down. Taking his cue from his chief,
Sir <span class="sc">Hamar Greenwood</span> excused his lack
of information about recent occurrences
with the remark that "an officer cannot
draw up reports while he is chasing assassins."
Tragedy gave way to comedy
when Lieutenant-Commander <span class="sc">Kenworthy</span>
observed that the proceedings
were "just like the German Reichstag
during the War." "Were you there?"
smartly interjected General <span class="sc">Croft</span>.</p>

<p>
The Government of Ireland Bill having
been recommitted, Sir <span class="sc">Worthington
Evans</span> explained the Government's
expedient for providing the new Irish
Parliaments with Second Chambers.
Frankly admitting that the Cabinet had
been unable to evolve a workable scheme&mdash;an
elected Senate would fail to protect
the minority and a nominated
Senate would be "undemocratic"&mdash;he
proposed that the Council of Ireland
should be entrusted with the task.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;">
<a href="images/393-2.png"><img src="images/393-2-300.png" width="300" height="264" alt="TWO BY TWO." /></a>
<h4>"TWO BY TWO."</h4>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Sir E. Carson and Mr. Devlin</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>
Having regard to the probable composition
of the Council&mdash;half Sinn
Feiners and half Orangemen&mdash;Colonel
<span class="sc">Guinness</span> feared there was no chance
of its agreeing unless most of them
were laid up with broken heads or some
other malady. Sir <span class="sc">Edward Carson</span>,
however, in an unusually optimistic
vein, expressed the hope that once
the North was assured of not being
put under the South and the South was
relieved of British dictation they would
"shake hands for the good of Ireland."
The clause was carried by 175 to 31.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;">
<a href="images/393-3.png"><img src="images/393-3-200.png" width="200" height="279" alt="THE OLD SHEEP-DOG." /></a>
<h4>THE OLD SHEEP-DOG.</h4>
<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>.</i> "<span class="sc">Tut-tut! To think that
I could only round up ten of 'em</span>!"</p>
</div>
<p>
On another new clause, providing for
the administration of Southern Ireland
in the event of a Parliament not being
set up, Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span> declared that "this
musty remainder biscuit" had reduced
him to "rhetorical poverty." Perhaps
that was why he could get no more
than ten Members to follow him into
the Lobby against it.</p>

<p>
<i>Tuesday, November 9th.</i>&mdash;In supporting
Lord <span class="sc">Parmoor's</span> protest against
the arrest, at Holyhead, of an English
lady by order of the Irish Executive,
Lord <span class="sc">Buckmaster</span> regretted that there
was no one in the House of Lords responsible
for the Irish Office, and consequently
"they were always compelled
to accept official answers." A strictly
official answer was all he got from
Lord <span class="sc">Crawford</span>, who declared that the
arrest had been made under the authority
of D.O.R.A., and gave
their Lordships the surely otiose
reminder that "conditions
were not quite simple or normal
in Ireland just now."</p>
<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Shortt</span> has formed his
style on the model of one of
his predecessors in office, who
used to be described as the
Quite-at-Home Secretary, and
he declined to share Colonel
<span class="sc">Burn's</span> alarm at the prevalence
of revolutionary speeches.
Hyde Park, he reminded him,
had always been regarded as a
safety-valve for discontented
people. Even Mr. <span class="sc">L'Estrange
Malone's</span> recent reference to
Ministers and lamp-posts did
not at that moment disturb
him.</p>
<p>
The new Ministry of Health
Bill had a rather rough passage,
and, if the voting had
been in accordance with the
speeches, it would hardly have secured
a second reading. Particular objection
was raised to the proposal to put the
hospitals on the rates. Mr. <span class="sc">Myers</span>,
however, was sarcastic at the expense
of people who thought that "rates and
taxes must be saved though the people
perished," and declared that there was
plenty of war wealth to be drawn upon.</p>
<p>
Lieut.-Colonel <span class="sc">Hurst</span> objected to the
term "working-class" in the Bill. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>[pg 394]</span>
would encourage the Socialistic fallacy
that the people of England were
divided into two classes&mdash;the leisured
class and the working class; whereas
everybody knew that most of the
"leisured class" had no leisure and
many of the "working-class" did no
work.</p>
<p>
<i>Wednesday, November 10th.</i>&mdash;The
Peers welcomed Lord <span class="sc">Buxton</span> on his
advancement to an earldom, and then
proceeded to discuss the rights of the
inhabitants of Heligoland. Having
been handed over to Germany against
their will in 1890, they hoped that the
Treaty of Versailles would restore
them to British nationality. On the
contrary the Treaty has resulted in
the island being swamped by German
workmen employed in destroying
the fortifications. Lord
<span class="sc">Crawford</span> considered
that the new electoral
law requiring three years'
residence would safeguard
the islanders from
being politically submerged,
and wisely did
not enter into the question
of how long the island
itself would remain
after the fortifications
had disappeared.</p>
<p>
In the Commons the
<span class="sc">Indian Secretary</span> underwent
his usual Wednesday
cross-examination.
He did not display quite
his customary urbanity.
When an hon. Member,
whose long and distinguished
Indian service
began in the year in which
Mr. <span class="sc">Montagu</span> was born,
ventured to suggest that
he should check Mr. <span class="sc">Gandhi's</span> appeals
to ignorance and fanaticism, he tartly
replied that ignorance and fanaticism
were very dangerous things, "whether
in India or on the benches of this
House."</p>
<p>
Mr. <span class="sc">Stewart</span> expressed anxiety lest
under the new arrangements with
Egypt the Sudan water-supply should
be subjected to Egyptian interference.
Mr. <span class="sc">Harmsworth</span> was of opinion that
for geographical reasons the Sudan
would always be able to look after its
own water-supply; <i>vide</i> the leading
case of <i>Wolf</i> v. <i>Lamb</i>.</p>
<p>
<i>Thursday, November 11th.</i>&mdash;The
<span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> was in a more aggressive
mood than usual. Mr. <span class="sc">Devlin</span>,
who was noisily incredulous as to the
existence of a Sinn Fein conspiracy
with Germany in 1918, was advised to
wait for the documents about to be published.
To make things even, an ultra-Conservative
Member, who urged the
suspension of Mr. <span class="sc">Fisher's</span> new Act,
was informed that the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>
could conceive nothing more serious than
that the nation should decide that it
could not afford to give children a good
education.</p>
<p>
Any doubts as to the suitability of
Armistice Day for the Third Reading of
the Government of Ireland Bill were
removed by the tone of the debate.
The possibility that the "Unknown
Warrior" might have been an Irishman
softened the feeling on both sides,
and though Mr. <span class="sc">Adamson</span> feared that
the Bill would bring Ireland not peace
but a sword, and Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span> appealed
to the Government to substitute a
measure more generous to Irish aspirations,
there was no sting in either of
their speeches. The <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>,
while defending his scheme as the best
that could be granted in the present
temper of Southern Ireland, did not
bang the door against further negotiations;
and Sir <span class="sc">Edward Carson</span> said
that Ulstermen were beginning to realize
that the Parliament thrust upon
them might be a blessing in disguise,
and expressed the hope that in working
it they would set an example of tolerance
and justice to all classes. Barely
a third of the House took part in the
division, and no Irish Member voted for
the Third Reading, which was carried by
183 votes to 52; but, having regard to
the influence of the unexpected in Irish
affairs, this apparent apathy may be a
good sign. After thirty-five years of
acute strife, Home Rule for Ireland is,
at any rate, no longer a party question.</p>

<h3>THE GREAT IDEA.</h3>
<p>
Perkins has got hold of a brilliant
idea. He explained it to me in the
Tube yesterday.</p>
<p>
"Our little world," he said, "is turned
topsy-turvy."</p>
<p>
"Knocked absolutely sideways," I
replied.</p>
<p>
"Those who were rich in the old
days," said Perkins, "haven't two sixpences
to rub together, and the world's
workers are rolling in Royces and
having iced méringues with every meal.
What follows?"</p>
<p>
"Indigestion," I said promptly.</p>
<p>
"Everybody," he said, ignoring my
<i>jeu d'esprit</i>, "feels like a fish out of
water, and discontent is rife. The newly-poor
man wishes he had in him the stuff
of which millionaires are
made, and the profiteer
sighs for a few pints of
the true ultramarine Norman
blood, as it would
be so helpful when dealing
with valets, gamekeepers
and the other
haughty vassals of his
new entourage. And
that is where my scheme
comes in. There are
oceans of blue blood surging
about in the veins
and arteries of dukes and
other persons who have
absolutely no further use
for such a commodity,
and I'm sure lots of it
could be had at almost
less than the present
price of milk. So what
is to prevent the successful
hosier from having
the real stuff coursing through
the auricles and ventricles of
his palpitating heart, since transfusion
is such a simple stunt nowadays?"</p>
<p>
"And I suppose," I said, "that you
would bleed him first so as to make
room for the new blood?"</p>
<p>
"There you touch the real beauty
of my idea," said Perkins. "The plebeian
sighs for aristocratic blood to
enable him to hold his own in his novel
surroundings; the aristocrat could do
with a little bright red fluid to help him
to turn an honest penny. So it is merely
a case of cross-transfusion; no waste,
no suffering, no weakness from loss of
blood on either side."</p>
<p>
I gasped at the magnitude of the idea.</p>
<p>
"I'm drawing up plans," Perkins
continued, "for a journal devoted to the
matter, in which the interested parties
can advertise their blood-stock for disposal,
a sort of 'Blood Exchange and
Mart.' The advertisements alone would
pay, I expect, for the cost of production.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>[pg 395]</span>
See," he said, handing me a slip of paper,
"these are the sort of ads. we should
get."</p>
<p>
This is what I read:&mdash;</p>
<p>
"Peer, ruined by the War, would sell
one-third of arterial contents for cash,
or would exchange blood-outfits with
successful woollen manufacturer.&mdash;5016
Kensington Gore, W.</p>
<p>
"To War Profiteers. Several quarts of
the real cerulean for disposal. Been in
same family for generations. Pedigree
can be inspected at office of advertiser's
solicitor. Cross-transfusion not objected
to. Address in first instance,
<span class="sc">Bart</span>., 204, Bleeding Heart Yard, E.C.</p>
<p>
"Public School and University Man of
Plantagenet extraction would like to
correspond with healthy Coal Miner
with view to cross-transfusion. Would
sell soul for two shillings.&mdash;A. <span class="sc">Vane-Bludyer</span>,
135, Down (and Out) Street,
West Kensington, W."</p>
<p>
"Makes your blood run cold," I said,
handing back the paper.</p>
<p>
"Not it," he said, detaching himself
from the strap as the train drew into
King's Cross; "not if the operation's
properly performed."</p>

<h3>A TRAGEDY IN BIRDLAND.</h3>

<div class="poem1">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Percy is a partridge bold</p>
<p>Who in Autumn, so I'm told,</p>
<p>Dwells among the turnip roots</p>
<p>And assists at frequent shoots,</p>
<p>Really I have seldom heard</p>
<p>Of a more precocious bird;</p>
<p>Possibly his landlord's not</p>
<p>What you'd call a first-rate shot,</p>
<p>And his pals, though jolly chaps,</p>
<p>Are not quite so good perhaps;</p>
<p>Still, he thinks their aim so trashy</p>
<p>That, I fear, he's getting rash. He</p>
<p>Even perches on the end</p>
<p>Of the gun my poor old friend</p>
<p>Bill employs for killing game.</p>
<p>True he's very blind and lame,</p>
<p>And he's well beyond the span</p>
<p>Meted out to mortal man,</p>
<p>And his gout is getting worse</p>
<p>(Meaning Bill, of course, not Perce);</p>
<p>Still, if he won't mend his ways,</p>
<p>One of these fine Autumn days</p>
<p>I'm afraid there's bound to be</p>
<p>Quite an awful tragedy.</p>

<p>So he boldly took his stand</p>
<p>Where the barrel ended, and,</p>
<p>All agog to solve the puzzle,</p>
<p>Poked his napper up the muzzle.</p></div>

<h3>BEAU BRIMACOMBE.</h3>
<p>
"Well, Uncle Tom," I said, leaning
over the gate, "and what did you think
of London?"</p>
<p>
On Monday morning Uncle Tom
Brimacombe had driven off in his trap
with his wife to the nearest station,
five miles away, and had gone up to
London for the first time in his life,
"to see about a legacy."</p>
<p>
"Lunnon! mai laife. It's a vaine
plaace. Ai used 'think Awkeyampton
was a big town, but ai'm barmed if
Lunnon dawn't beat un.</p>
<p>
"As you knaw, Zur, us 'ad to get up

and us got upalong Lunnon 'bout tain.
Well, the waife knew 'er waay 'bout,

Zo when us gets out of the traain us

'wur be us gwaine then?'</p>
<p>
"'Dawn'ee axno questions, me dyur,'
sez the waife, 'or ai'll vorget ahl what

<p>
"Well, baimbai the caage stops gwaine

Well, we zat us down and thur was

<p>

<p>
"'Dawn'ee taake naw nawtice of

"'Theym bin and put yure vottygraff

out and keep'n. Yur 'tis if 'eed laike
to see un."</p>
<p>
Uncle Tom fumbled in his pocket,
drew out a cutting and handed it to me.
There surely enough was a photo of
him and "the waife," sitting on a public
garden-seat eating pasties and underneath
the legend&mdash;</p>

<h4>THE CYNOSURE.</h4>
<p>
Among the passengers on the boat
was a tall dark man with a black moustache
and well-cut clothes who spent
most of his time walking the deck or
reading alone in his chair. Every ship
has such recluses, who often, however,
are on the fringe of several sets, although
members of none. But this man remained
apart and, being so determined
and solitary, he was naturally the subject
of comment and inquiry, even more
of conjecture. His name was easy to
discover from the plan of the table, but
we knew no more until little Mrs. King,
who is the best scout in the world,
brought the tidings.</p>
<p>
"I can't tell you much," she began
breathlessly; "but there's something
frightfully interesting. Colonel Swift
knows all about him. He met him
once in Poona and they have mutual
friends. And how do you think he described
him? He says he's the worst
liver in India."</p>
<p>
There is no need to describe the sensation
created by this piece of information.
If the man had set us guessing
before, he now excited a frenzy of
curiosity. The glad news traversed the
ship like wind, brightening every eye;
at any rate every female eye. For,
though the good may have their reward
elsewhere, it is beyond doubt that, if
public interest is any guerdon, the bad
get it on earth.</p>
<p>
Show me a really bad man&mdash;dark-complexioned,
with well-cut clothes and
a black moustache&mdash;and I will show
you a hero; a hero a little distorted, it is
true, but not much the less heroic for
that. Show me a notorious breaker of
male hearts and laws and&mdash;so long as
she is still in business&mdash;I will show you
a heroine; again a little distorted, but
with more than the magnetism of the
virtuous variety.</p>
<p>
For the rest of the voyage the lonely
passenger was lonely only because he preferred
to be, or was unaware of the agitation
which he caused. People walked
for hours longer than they liked or even
intended in order to have a chance of
passing him in his chair and scrutinising
again the features that masked such
depravity. For that they masked it
cannot be denied. A physiognomist
looking at him would have conceded a
certain gloom, a trend towards introspection,
possibly a hypertrophied love
of self, but no more. Physiognomists,
however, can retire from the case, for
they are as often wrong as hand-writing
experts. And if any Lavater had
been on board and had advanced such
a theory he would have been as unpopular
as <span class="sc">Jonah</span>, for the man's wickedness
was not only a joy to us but a support.
Without it the voyage would
have been interminable.</p>
<p>
What, we all wondered, had he done?
Had he murdered as well as destroyed so
many happy homes? Was he crooked
at cards? Our minds became acutely
active, but we could discover no more
because the old Colonel, the source of
knowledge, had fallen ill and was invisible.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the screw revolved, sweepstakes
were lost and won, deck sports
flourished, fancy-dress dances were held,
concerts were endured, a Colonial Bishop
addressed us on Sunday mornings and
the tall dark man with the black moustache
and different suits of well-cut
clothes sat in his chair and passed
serenely from one <span class="sc">Oppenheim</span> to another
as though no living person were
within leagues.</p>
<p>
It was not until we were actually in
port that the Colonel recovered and I
came into touch with him. Standing
by the rail we took advantage of the
liberty to speak together, which on a
ship such propinquity sanctions. After
we had exchanged a few remarks about
the clumsiness of the disembarking
arrangements I referred to the man of
mystery and turpitude, and asked for
particulars of some of his milder
offences.</p>
<p>
"Why do you suppose him such a
blackguard?" he asked.</p>
<p>
"But surely&mdash;&mdash;" I began, a little
disconcerted.</p>
<p>
"He's a man," the Colonel continued,
"that everyone should be sorry
for. He's a wreck, and he's going home
now probably to receive his death sentence."</p>
<p>
This was a promising phrase and I
cheered up a little, but only for a moment.</p>
<p>
"That poor devil," said the Colonel,
"as I told Mrs. King earlier in the voyage,
has the worst liver in India."</p>

<h3>THE HAPPY GARDENER.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Extracts from a Synthetic Diary à la mode.</i>)</p>
<p>
<i>November 11th.</i>&mdash;Now is the time to plant salsify, or the
vegetable oyster, as it has been aptly named from its crustacean
flavour so dear to herbaceous boarders. This may
be still further accentuated by planting it in soil containing
lime, chalk or other calcareous or sebaceous deposits.</p>
<p>
Hedgehogs are now in prime condition for baking, but it
is desirable to remove the quills before entrusting the animal
to the oven. But the hedgehog cannot be cooked until he
is caught, and his capture should not be attempted without
strong gloves. Those recently invented by Lord <span class="sc">Thanet</span>
are far the best for the purpose. It is a moot point among
culinary artists whether the hedgehog should be served <i>en
casserole</i>  or in <i>coquilles</i>; but these are negligible details
when you are steeped in the glamour of pale gold from a
warm November sun, and mild air currents lag over the level
leagues where the water is but slightly crimped and the
alighting heron is lost among the neutral tints that envelop
him....</p>
<p>
Though the sun's rays are not now so fervent as they
were in the dog-days, gardening without any headgear is
dangerous, especially in view of the constant stooping. For
the protection of the <i>medulla</i> nothing is better than the
admirable hat recently placed on the market by the benevolent
enterprise of a great newspaper. But an effective
substitute can be improvised out of a square yard of linoleum
lined with cabbage-leaves and fastened with a couple of
safety-pins.</p>
<p>
As the late Sir <span class="sc">Andrew Clark</span> remarked in a luminous
phrase, Nature forgives but she never forgets. The complete
gardener should always aim (unlike the successful
journalist) at keeping his head cool and his feet warm; and
here again the noble enterprise of a newspaper has provided
the exact <i>desideratum</i> in its happily-named Corkolio detachable
soles, which are absolutely invaluable when roads
are dark and ways are foul, when the reeds are sere, when
all the flowers have gone and the carrion-crow from the
vantage of a pollard utters harsh notes of warning to all the
corvine company round about....</p>
<p>
Shod with Corkolio the happy gardener can defy these
sinister visitants and ply the task of "heeling over" broccoli
towards the north with perfect impunity.</p>
<p>
The ravages of stag-beetles, a notable feature of late
seasons, and probably one of the indirect but none the less
disastrous results of the Land Valuation policy of the <span class="sc">Prime
Minister</span>, can be kept down by leaving bowls of caviare
mixed with molasses in the places which they most frequent.
This compound reduces them speedily to a comatose condition,
in which they can be safely exterminated with the
aid of the patent hot-air pistolette (price five guineas) recently
invented by a director of one of the journals already
alluded to.</p>
<p>
But <i>tout lasse, tout casse, tout passe</i>; and while the kingfisher
turns his sapphire back in the sun against the lemon-yellow
of the willow leaves, and the smouldering russet of
the oak-crowns succeeds to the crimson of the beeches and
the gold of the elms, we shall do well to emulate the serene
magnanimity of Nature and console ourselves with the reflection
that the rural philosopher, if only assured of a sympathetic
hearing in an enlightened Press and provided with
a suitable equipment by the ingenuity of its directors, may
contemplate the vagaries of tyrannical misgovernment with
fortitude and even felicity.</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>
<p>
In looking at the title-page of <i>John Seneschal's Margaret</i>
(<span class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</span>) no lover of good stories but will
be saddened by the reflection that the superscription, "by
<span class="sc">Agnes</span> and <span class="sc">Egerton Castle</span>," is there seen for the last
time. The double signature, herald of how much pleasure
in the past, is here attached to a cheerfully improbable but
well-told tale of the after-war about a returned soldier who
was mistaken for his dead fellow-prisoner and hailed as son,
heir and <i>fiancé</i>  by the different members of the welcoming
group in the home that wasn't his. The descriptions of
this home, by the way&mdash;a house whose identification will
be easy enough for those who know the beautiful North-Dorset
country&mdash;are as good as any part of the book. If you
protest that the resulting situation is not only wildly improbable
but becoming a stock-in-trade of our novelists, I
must admit the first charge, but point out that the authors
here secure originality by making the deception an unintended
one. <i>John Tempest</i>,  who in the hardships of his
escape has lost memory of his own identity, never ceases
to protest that he is at least not the other <i>John</i> for whom
the members of the <i>Seneschal</i> family persist in taking him&mdash;a
twist that makes for piquancy if hardly for added probability.
However, the inevitable solution of the problem
provides a story entertaining enough, though not, I think,
one that will obliterate your memory of others, incomparable,
from hands to which we all owe a debt of long enjoyment.</p>
<p>
I read <i>Inisheeny</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>), as I believe I have read
every story by the same hand, at one sitting. Whose was
the hand I will ask you to guess. Characters: one Church
of Ireland parson, drily humorous, as narrator; one lively
heroine with archæological father, hunting for relics; one
schoolboy; one young and over-zealous R.I.C. officer on the
look-out for concealed arms; poachers, innkeepers, peasants,
etc. Action, mostly amphibious, passes between the mainland
of Western Ireland and a small islet off the coast.
Will the gentleman who said "<span class="sc">George A. Birmingham</span>"
kindly consider himself entitled to ten nuts? I suppose it
was the mention of an islet that finally gave away my simple
secret. Mr. "<span class="sc">Birmingham</span>" is one of the too few authors
who understand what emotion an island of the proper size
and right distance from the coast can raise in the human
breast. <i>Inisheeny</i> delightfully fulfilled every condition in
this respect; not to mention sheltering an illicit still and
being the home of Keltic treasure. Precisely in fact the
right kind of place, and the sort of story that hardly anyone
can put down unfinished. I am bound to add that,
perhaps a hundred pages from the actual end, the humour
of the affair seems to lose spontaneity and become forced.
But till the real climax of the tale, the triumphant return
of the various hunters from <i>Inisheeny</i>,  I can promise
that you will find never a dull page.</p>

  <hr />
<p>
There were moments in <i>The Headland</i> (<span class="sc">Heinemann</span>)
when, with <i>Roma Lennox</i>, the "companion" and heroine, I
"shivered, feeling that London, compared with the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>[pg 400]</span>
house on the Headland and the family inhabiting it, was a
clean place with a clear atmosphere and inhabited by
robust, sane, straightforward persons. You felt homesick."
Cornwall is notoriously inhabited by queer people, and the
<i>Pendragon</i> family was not merely queer but hereditarily
rotten and decadent: the old father, who burns a valuable
old book of his own to appease his violent temper; the
granddaughter a kleptomaniac; the son of forty addicted to
hideous cruelties. Unpleasant but well drawn, all of them.
Mrs. <span class="sc">C. A. Dawson Scott</span> has powerfully suggested the
atmosphere of the strange and tragic household, mourning
its dead mistress; and she understands the peculiar quality
of the Cornish people and the Cornish seas. I have not read
her other novels, but, if she will promise to wrestle with
one or two rather irritating mannerisms, I will promise to
look out for her next one. I have no prejudice against the
Wellsian triplet of dots, but really Mrs. Scott does overdo
it. And a good deal of her quite penetrating psycho-thingummy
was spoiled for me by her trick of conveying
nearly every impression
and reflection of
her characters through
an impersonal "you"
or "one." This means
an economy of words
and for a short time a
certain vividness, but it
soon becomes tedious.
One knows what a
tangle you get into if
one starts using "one's"
and "you's" in your
letters; and you find
that the author has
been caught once or
twice. However, the
story is good enough
to survive that.</p>

  <hr />
<p>
The title of <i>The Lady
of The Lawn</i> (<span class="sc">Jenkins</span>)
has "the ornament of
alliteration," but beyond
that there doesn't
seem to be any particular
reason why Mr. W. <span class="sc">Riley</span> should have chosen it.
Certainly in his story there is an old lady who spends
more of the winter on a lawn than any old lady of my
acquaintance could be induced to, even with rugs and a
summer-house to make up for the comforts of the fireside;
but <i>Miss Barbara</i> and her site really have not so much to
do with the tale as its title seems to imply. The love affairs
of a young officer who, while blind from wounds, fell in love
with his nurse to the extent of becoming engaged to her
and didn't recognise her when they met again, are Mr.
<span class="sc">Riley's</span> real concern. <i>Eric</i>, who is quite as priggish as his
name suggests, falls in love with his sweetheart, as a lady
of leisure, all over again, and goes through agonies of remorse
on account of his own faithlessness to her as a nurse.
<i>Marion</i> or <i>Constance</i>, for she uses two names to help the
confusion, lets him suffer a while for the good of his soul,
but the happy ending, the promise of which is breathed
from every line of the book, is duly brought about. His
publisher asserts that "there is no living author who writes
about Yorkshire as does Mr. <span class="sc">Riley</span>." I daresay he is quite
right, but at least as far as the present book is concerned I
don't think that I should have bothered to mention it.</p>

  <hr />
<p>
Those&mdash;and I suspect they are many&mdash;whose first real
enthusiasm for <span class="sc">Abraham Lincoln</span> was kindled by Mr. <span class="sc">John
Drinkwater's</span> romantic morality play can profitably take
up Mr. <span class="sc">Irving Bacheller's</span> <i>A Man for the Ages</i> (<span class="sc">Constable</span>)
for an engaging account of the early days of the great
Democrat. They will forgive a certain flamboyance about
the author's preliminaries. Hero-worship, if the hero be
worthy, is a very pardonable weakness, and they should
certainly admire the skill and humour with which he has
patched together, or invented where seemly, the story of
lanky <span class="sc">Abe</span>, with his axeman's skill, his immense physical
strength, his poor head for shopkeeping, his passion for
books, his lean purse and "shrinking pants," his wit, courage
and resource. A romance of reasonable interest and plausibility
is woven round young Lincoln's story. Perhaps
Mr. <span class="sc">Bacheller</span> makes his hero speak a little too sententiously
at times, and certainly some of his other folk say
queer things, such as, "What so vile as a cheap aristocracy,
growing up in idleness, too noble to be restrained, with
every brutal passion broad-blown as flush as May?" What
indeed! The picture of
pioneering America in
the thirties is a fresh
and interesting one.</p>

  <hr />
<p>
To few of those who
visit Switzerland, with
its incomparable mountains,
can it have occurred
that, once a man
is kept there against
his will, it can be a
prison as damnable as
any other; possibly even
more damnable by reason
of those same inevitable
mountains. British
prisoners of war interned
there knew that.
Mr. <span class="sc">R. O. Prowse</span>, in
<i>A Gift of the Dusk</i>
(<span class="sc">Collins</span>), speaks with
subtle penetration for
those other prisoners,
interned victims of the
dreadful malady. Of
necessity he writes sadly; but yet he writes as a very
genial philosopher, permitting himself candidly "just that
little cynicism which helps to keep one tolerant." He is
of the old and entertaining school of sentimental travellers,
but he is far from being old-fashioned. The story running
through his observations and modern instances is so frail and
delicate a thing that I hesitate to touch it and to risk disturbing
its bloom. All readers, save the very young and
the very old, will do well to travel with him, from Charing
Cross ("I have a childlike fondness for trains. I like to be
in them, I like to see them go by") to the peaceful, almost
happy end, at the mountain refuge by the valley of the
Rhone. They will not regret an inch of the way; and they
will derive some very positive enjoyment from the picture
of that most melancholy hotel where the story is set.</p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
